      <h1>The Alan Turing Institute<br/><em>Year 2017 in numbers</em></h1>
      <p>
        The Alan Turing Institute is the United Kingdom national institute for data sciences, 
        founded in 2015. It is named after Alan Turing, the British mathematician and computing pioneer.
        Since getting started in 2015, the institute hired its first Research Fellows, published 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcr5vuAH5TPlYox-QLj4ySw">numerous recorded talks</a>,
        <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/publications/">over 50 publications</a> and started
        new <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/category/research/projects/">research projects</a>
        that aim to advance the fields of data science, machine learning and many more.</p>
      <p>Here, we present information about the Alan Turing Institute in a fun interactive way.
        We are using tools developed as part of <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research_projects/the-gamma/">The 
        Gamma</a> project, which make it possible to present data in a transparent way. Behind 
        every chart on this page, there is source code that links the chart to the primary data
        source and lets you explore the data further. The visualizations are inspired by
        <a href="https://nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/15/us/politics/you-draw-obama-legacy.html">the
        You Draw It series by New York Times</a> and let you make your own guess about the data
        before showing the actual numbers. How many of the facts about the Alan Turing Institute
        can you guess correctly?

        as <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/">listed on the institute web page</a>.
        This includes Research Fellows who work full-time at the institute, Faculty Fellows 
        who divide their time between the host university and the instiute and Doctoral 
        Students who spent one year of their PhD at the institute.</p>
      <p>Can you guess how many Research Fellows, Faculty Fellows, Doctoral Students and
        members of the Leadership team are there? </p>

        month to several days a week and each university prefers different arrangements.</p>

      <h2><span>Talks at the Alan Turing Institute</span></h2>
      <p style="margin-top:20px">
        The Alan Turing Institute has been hosting a number of talk series and posting the 
        recording on YouTube throughout the year. Videos from the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnLU1sZLQR4&list=PLuD_SqLtxSdU774xWBKNjg54GgNpKvWbC">Fellow
        Short Talks series</a> feature the current research of the Research Fellows and Falculty Fellows.
        The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7ehrXZfIS0&list=PLuD_SqLtxSdVDcrCYIHayTL91DapuIHrO">Turing
        Lectures series</a> contains invited talks from researchers across the world.
        The chart below shows the aggregate number of video views for all
        the talks posted on YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>Note that the chart below is calculated from a data dump from YouTube and so
        you can click "view source code" and explore the data on your own. For example,
        try looking at the number of subscribers rather than the number of views!

      <h3><span>When are videos published</span></h3>
      <p>Let's now have a more detailed look at the YouTube video views. The bubble chart
        shows when each video was published together with the total number of views since
        it was published. This means that older videos had more time to get more views.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see huge spike in activity around October 2016 when regular talk series started
        and then a break around Christmas 2016. Since then, activity has been more regular.
      </p>
      <p>Now the game part! The line chart below shows total video views per day. This jumps
        up and down, so the line chart shows average values over two weeks. Can you guess 
        the rest of the line?</p>
      <p>As with the previous charts, you can click "open source code" to see how the visualization
        is created. Change the window size on the second line from 15 to 1 or 30 to see how
        it changes!

        a number of talks (selected by hand) that illustrate the breadth of the topics
        covered by the institute. You can explore and select other talks if you click
